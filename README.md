### Simple Game Project in C++ created by Paweł Frąckowiak in one week! (2023)

#### A few words from the author:

I had only 7 days to familiarize myself with the workings of C++ and create a game in this language. For my first project of this type, it went well and I learned a lot. It's possible that I will create more projects in this language, most likely on Unreal Engine 5.
